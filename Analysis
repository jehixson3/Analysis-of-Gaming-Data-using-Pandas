Analysis of Heroes of Pymoli purchasing Data
While the vast majority of purchasers are male (84%), but the females players tend to both spend 
more per item and have a higher total purchase per person.  I would recommend grouping the items purchased by 
female and seeing which items they tend to purchase the most and do a mini marketing campaign and e-mailing exclusively offers
to them for the more expensive items.  Also, most purchasers are from the ages of 15 – 19, 20 – 24 age groups, 
I would recommend breaking these ages down further to see which items they tended to buy the most and which additional ones 
could be marketed to them.  Lastly, I would like to know when the players purchased the items, was it at the beginning, 
middle or end of the game.  When someone loses a game, should they be offered a chance to buy more items for their next challenge?  
Should the game remember how they lost the last time and make recommendations on items they can purchase to get beyond their last level.
